Previously, I was at [Correlia Biosystems](https://correliabio.com) as a Software Engineering Intern working on remote diagnostic tools and outlier rejection algorithms. Before that, I was at [Dataherald](http://dataherald.com) as a Product Management and Software Engineering Intern where I was the Sole PM of a YC Startup. I shipped and built a series of [Census 2020 real-time visualization dashboards](https://www.sunherald.com/news/local/article253451084.html) to over 140,000 readers and 500,000 impressions -- at then, a company record.

On campus, I'm involved with teaching [CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org) as a TA and involved as a Senior Advisor at [UpSync Consulting](https://www.upsyncberkeley.com).

Have any ideas to discuss? Feel free to reach out below, I'd love to chat!
