Hi! I'm an alum of <a href='https://met.berkeley.edu/'>UC Berkeley Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program</a> where I did a dual degree in EECS and Business. I'm interested in building accurate LLM & ML systems, low-level systems, and general software systems with a bias for building fast.

My experiences include:

- Cofounder & CTO of [Relta](https://relta.dev/), where I built a Python library enabling SaaS developers to build accurate & secure user-facing AI Assistants integrated with that user's relational data. See here for some [demos](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gaurav-bhatnagar_if-you-want-people-to-build-things-make-activity-7257825187759366145-I6g9), [documentation](https://docs.relta.dev/), and [blog posts](https://medium.com/relta)
- PM & SWE Intern at [Dataherald (YC W21)](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dataherald), sole PM of a YC startup as a college freshman. Authored PRDs, got CEO and CTO alignment, built ETL pipelines, and led shipment of various live visualization dashboards. Set best launch-day performance at the time; >140,000 active users and 500,000 impressions.
- SWE Intern at [Segmed (YC W20)](https://www.segmed.ai), built end-to-end dev and live testing framework for medical SaaS
- SWE Intern at [Correlia Biosystems (YC W18)](https://correliabio.com), designed remote diagnostic tools and outlier rejection algorithms for robotic pharmaceutical devices

Here's a few things I did on campus:

- 3x student researcher under [Prof. S. Shankar Sastry](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sastry/) on designing a real-time ROS system to play ping pong, at [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) under [Prof. Natacha Crooks](https://nacrooks.github.io/) on query engines for a byzantine fault tolerant database, and at [CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/) under SJSU Asst. Prof. [Andrew Blanton](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/people/andrew-blanton) on real-time human pose streaming.
- 3x Teaching Assistant for [CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming](https://cs162.org) and [CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org) -- taught ~300 hours to ~100 students.
- VP of Projects and VP of Professional Development at [UpSync Consulting](https://www.upsyncberkeley.com) -- sourced pre-seed to series A companies for consulting projects, oversaw and trained 40 consultants.

I'm always looking to collaborate on existing or new projects. Feel free to reach out below.
