Hi! I'm a senior majoring in EECS & Business at <a href='https://met.berkeley.edu/'>UC Berkeley Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program</a>. I'm interested in managing tangible technology; robots, digital products, and more. I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at [Segmed](https://www.segmed.ai) working on live testing frameworks.

Previously, I was at [Correlia Biosystems](https://correliabio.com) as a Software Engineering Intern working on remote diagnostic tools and outlier rejection algorithms. Before that, I was at [Dataherald](http://dataherald.com) as a Product Management and Software Engineering Intern where I shipped and built a series of [Census 2020 real-time visualization dashboards](https://www.sunherald.com/news/local/article253451084.html) to over 140,000 readers and 500,000 impressions on the first day -- at then, a company record.

On campus, I'm an undergraduate student researcher under [Professor S. Shankar Sastry](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sastry/), on Course Staff for [CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming](https://cs162.org), and a Senior Advisor at [UpSync Consulting](https://www.upsyncberkeley.com). Previously, I was a Teaching Assistant for [CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org), on the web team of [The Berkeley Project](https://www.berkeleyproject.org), and completed research under Asst. Prof. [Andrew Blanton](https://music.berkeley.edu/people/7195-2/) at [CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu) on designing real-time rendering of motion capture data.

Have any ideas to discuss? Feel free to reach out below, I'd love to chat!
