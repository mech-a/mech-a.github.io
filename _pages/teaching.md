In Spring of 2024 and Fall of 2023, I was a uGSI (Berkeley-dialect for TA) for [CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming](https://cs162.org/), the main undergraduate systems course at Berkeley with ~400 students per semester. I held over 40 in-depth design reviews for implementing parts of the OS such as file systems and scheduling, weekly discussion, office hours, and designed exams. In total, I taught for over 120 hours.

In Spring of 2023, I was a uGSI for [CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org/), a core CS requirement with ~600 students per semester. I held bi-weekly discussion to over 30 students and office hours for the course. I have also been a 2-time Reader and Academic Intern for the course, leading to over 160 hours taught.
