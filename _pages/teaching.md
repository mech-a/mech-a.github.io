In Spring of 2023, I was a uGSI (Berkeley-dialect for TA) for [CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](https://www.eecs70.org/), a core CS requirement with ~500 students per semester. I held discussion and office hours for the course.

Some sample mini-lectures can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rammnz6rpDes94JXGDCBpnoSIOT7GKvU?usp=sharing).
